# Prostate Cancer Metabolomics Prediction
This repository was created as part of the course MSB1015 Scientific Programming taught at Maastricht University within the Systems Biology Master programme. This repository contains R scripts to install packages, pre-process raw metabolomics data and perform classification on the resulting data with random forests in Python. The data used and provided in this project was published by Benedetti et al. and can be found here: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02750-7.

The scripts in this repository are numbered in the order that they should be run in. Additionally preprocessed files and resulting figures will be added to facilitate understanding of the project without the need of running all code as some processes may take a while. Additonal R scripts were uploaded for data explorationa and visualization or are referred to in the main script. Only the numbered scripts are necessary to perform the proposed analysis.
