# Prostate Cancer Metabolomics Prediction
This repository was created as part of the course MSB1015 Scientific Programming taught at Maastricht University within the Systems Biology Master programme. This repository contains R scripts to install packages, pre-process raw metabolomics data and perform classification on the resulting data with random forests in Python. The data used and provided in this project was published by Benedetti et al. and can be found here: https://www.nature.com/articles/s41597-023-02750-7.
# Running the analysis
The repository contains two main scripts 1_preprocessing.R and 2_classifier.ipynb. Both of these scripts can be run independently as pre-processed data is available for the latter to import directly. For replication of the analysis performed in this project run the scripts in order of their numbering. Additionally for the R packages a script was added 0_install_and_load_packages.R which downloads the necessary libraries automatically.
Additonal R scripts were uploaded for data explorationa and visualization or are referred to in the main script. Furthermore, data and visualizations are readily provided for potential interpretation an reuse.
